Examples and exercises to learn about encryption.

I started this project to help me understand the encryption techniques Simon Singh explains in his fantastic book 
[The Code Book - The Science of Secrecy From Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography (Anchor Books, 2000)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Code_Book). 
I plan to work with the concepts of cryptography and cryptanalysis history laid out by Singh in his book by implementing 
the algorithms, to the best of my abilities, with small Python snippets and libraries. The purpose of this site is entirely 
educational and mainly for my benefit. But I do hope that someone else can find it a helpful companion for their journey 
into the world of secrets.
