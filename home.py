I started this project to help me understand the encryption techniques Simon Singh explains in his fantastic book \
[The Code Book - The Science of Secrecy From Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography (Anchor Books, 2000)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Code_Book). 
I plan to work with the concepts of cryptography and cryptanalysis history laid out by Singh in his book by implementing \
the algorithms, to the best of my abilities, with small Python snippets and libraries. The purpose of this site is entirely \
educational and mainly for my benefit. But I do hope that someone else can find it a helpful companion for their journey \
into the world of secrets.
